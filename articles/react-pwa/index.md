In this tutorial, we will create a React Todo Progressive Web App. A progressive web app refers to an enhanced web application having the same capabilities as a native platform-specific application by utilizing the emerging browser APIs. The Progressive Web Apps are intended to be fast, reliable, and engaging.

### Prerequisites

1. Knowledge of the [JavaScript programming language](https://www.w3schools.com/js/DEFAULT.asp).

2. Basics of React library. Check documentation [here](https://www.reactjs.org).

3. A basic knowledge of [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

4. A code editor, I will use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

### Getting started
First, you should have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download the latest version [here](https://www.nodejs.org). The installed version of Node.js runtime comes pre-installed with a node.js package manager(npm).

To confirm that Node.js has been installed, open the terminal and execute the below command:

```bash
node --version
```

This shows the version of Node.js running on your system and that Node.js has been installed.


First, we now need to create a new React application using the boilerplate code generated by the
create-react-app command-line utility. On your terminal, execute the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app react-pwa --template cra-template-pwa
```

This will create a folder named `react-pwa`. The argument `--template cra-template-pwa` is added to create an app with service worker for Progressive Web App functionality,as version 4 or later will not provide a built-in service worker. We will use this part of the later. You can now open the project in your favorite code editor.

The folder structure will initially look similar to this:

```bash
node_modules/
public/
|--- favicon.ico
|--- index.html
|--- logo192.png
|--- manifest.json
|--- robots.txt
src/
|--- App.js
|--- App.css
|--- App.test.js
|--- index.js
|--- index.css
|--- service-worker.js
|--- serviceWorkerRegistration.js
|--- setupTest.js
|--- logo.svg
.eslintcache
.gitignore
package.json
package-lock.json
README.md
```

Our React code will be in the `src` folder. Inside this folder, delete the `logo.svg` and remove everything in both `App.css` and `App.js` files before we start to build the application.

### Creating UI components
We will have to break our application into components that represent the logical parts of the UI.

We shall have four functional components:

1. The App component.

2. The Form component.

3. The TodoList component.

4. The Todo component.

### The App component 
First, I have included the `App` component as it is the parent component of the `TodoList` and the `Form` components. I have included a CSS file for our styling named `App.css` which is in the same `src` root folder as our *App.js* file.

```javascript
import React,{useState} from 'react';

// components
import Form from './components/Form';
import TodoList from './components/TodoList';

// CSS files
import './App.css'

const App=()=>{

  const [todos,setTodos]=useState([]);

  const addTodo= todo=>{
          const newTodos=[todo,...todos];
           setTodos(newTodos);
       }
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>TODO PWA</h1>
      <Form addTodo={addTodo}/>
      <TodoList todos={todos} setTodos={setTodos}/>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
The App component walkthrough:
- We import the `TodoList` and `Form` component which we will create in the next steps. The CSS file named `App.css` is for basic styling of the application.
- Inside the function, the `useState` hook with `todos` and `setTodos` will create our state for todos as well as track changes on the application.
- The `addTodo` is a function that is used to add a new todo by calling the `setTodos` method to update the state.
- We use JSX to return a div containing `<h1>` tag as the header. The `Form` and `TodoList` components are mounted passing along the appropriate props. Let us now create the components in the below steps.

### Form component
This component will be used to add new todos. In your `src/` folder, create a new folder named `components`. Inside the `components` folder, you need to create a file named `Form.js`. 

This is the code for the `Form.js`:

```javascript
import React,{useState} from 'react';
import {v4 as uuidv4} from 'uuid';

const Form =({addTodo})=>{
    
    const [inputText,setInputText]=useState("");

    const inputTextHandler=(e)=>{
        setInputText(e.target.value);
    }
    const submitTodoHandler=(e)=>{
        e.preventDefault();
        if(inputText){
          addTodo({text:inputText,completed:false,id:uuidv4()});
        } 
        setInputText("");
    }

    return(
        <form onSubmit={submitTodoHandler}>
            <input type="text" value={inputText} placeholder="Add Todo" onChange={inputTextHandler}/>
            <button type="submit" className="add-btn">
                Add
            </button>
        </form>
    );
};

export default Form;
```

The Form component walkthrough:

- The code above implements function components alongside React hooks. Hooks are functions that let you have state and other lifecycle patterns from function components.

- We are using the `useState` hook that returns two values in an array. The first value is the state, and the second is a function to update the state. The method `inputTextHandler` bound on the input tag is invoked every time when the value of the input element changes.

- The form is a controlled component that will track the `inputText`. 

- When the submit event is fired on the form, the function `submitTodoHandler` is executed. We are checking that the input is not empty before creating a new todo in our `addTodo` function passed down from `App` component.

- The method `setInputText` inside the `submitTodoHandler` will reset the form.

The todo will be an object with a structure like:
```javascript

    {
      id:v4(),
      task,
      complete:false
    }
```  
This is the explanation for our todo:  
- The ID is a unique identifier or key for a specific todo task. I am using the `uuid` library to generate a unique id.
You can install the `uuid` package from the `npm` registry using this command in your terminal:
```bash
npm install uuid
```
- The complete property in the object is a boolean that checks whether our todo task is completed or not. If the task is complete,
    we will use a CSS class that adds a strike-through on the todo task marking it as complete.

### Creating the TodoList Component
This is the component that acts as a container to the list of the todo items.

You need to create a new file named `TodosList.js` inside the components folder. Since our Todo component is a child of the TodoList component, we will first need to create the TodoList.

The TodoList component is recieving todos state from the App component. We have [lifted its state up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html) in the App component so that our `TodoList` can access it via props.

To create this component, go into your components folder and create a new file named `TodoList.js`.

This component code is like:
```javascript
import React from "react";
import Todo from "./Todo";

const TodoList = ({ todos, setTodos }) => {
  const completeTodo = (id) => {
      let updatedTodos=todos.map(todo=>{
          if(todo.id===id){
              todo.completed=!todo.completed;
          }
          return todo;
      })
      setTodos(updatedTodos);
  };
  const removeTodo=(id)=>{
    setTodos(todos.filter(todo=>todo.id!==id));
  }

  return (
    <div className="todo-container">
      <ul className="todo-list">
        {todos.map((todo) => (
          <Todo key={todo.id}
            todo={todo}
            completeTodo={completeTodo} 
            removeTodo={removeTodo}/>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default TodoList;
```

In this component:
- The `TodoList` is receiving `todos` as an array of objects from the `App` component as props.
  
- In the return of our function, we map through the `todos` and return a JSX syntax with a new Todo component as the todo item.
  
- The `removeTodo` is a function which accepts an `id` that uniquely identifies the `todo` in our list. Whatever todo that does not match the provided `id` is filtered and stored in the state using `setTodos`.

We will use the `completeTodo` method to toggle between marked and completed state to determine the class to style it. 

### The Todo component
You need to add a new file and name it `Todo.js` in the components folder.

We created the functions that perform the complete and delete operations in our `TodoList` component. Clicking the *Check* button will invoke the `HandleComplete` that will call the function `completeTodo` passing the `id`.

The `HandleDelete` method will call the function `removeTodo` to filter out the todo by its `id`.
Check the code below:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const Todo=({todo,completeTodo,removeTodo})=>{
    
    const HandleComplete=()=>{
        completeTodo(todo.id);
    }
    const HandleDelete=()=>{
        removeTodo(todo.id);
    }

    return(
        <div>
            <div className="todo">
            <li className={todo.completed?"checked":""}>
                {todo.text}
            </li>
            <button onClick={HandleComplete} className="check-btn">{todo.completed?"Uncheck":"Check"}</button>
            <button className="delete-btn" onClick={HandleDelete}>Delete</button>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Todo;
```

### Application Styling
This tutorial assumes you know basics of CSS styling, so I have a basic CSS file: 

```css
body{
    background-color: rgb(72, 72, 247);
    font-size: 1.2rem;
    max-width: 100vw;
    max-height: 100vh;
}

input{
    padding:1.3rem 5rem;
    border:none;
    font-size: 1.1rem;
}
.add-btn{
    padding: 1.3rem;
    font-size: 1.1rem;
}

button{
    border:none;
    margin-right: 5px;

}

button:hover{
    transform: scale(0.98);
    transition: linear 0.8s;
    cursor: pointer;
}
.checked{
    color:rgb(240, 240, 247);
    text-decoration: line-through;
}
.todo{
    display: flex;
}

.check-btn{
    color:rgb(14, 14, 14);
    background-color: rgb(95, 130, 245);
}
.delete-btn{
    color: rgb(247, 238, 242);
    background-color: rgb(255, 38, 38);
}
```


### The React Application so far

### Adding functionality to make it a Progressive Web App
This is the section that we will briefly configure the Progressive Web App features using the workbox tool added during create-react-app installation. [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox) is a set of tools and libraries that help to manage service workers and caching with the `CacheStorage` API.

Some features of a progressive web app include:
1. It must be discoverable and installable
   
2. A Progressive web App must be able to work offline

3. Safety as it should rely on the HTTPS protocol 

4. Should look and feel like native apps i.e run on a fullscreen mode etc.
  
Our application will need functionalities to run offline, caching assets by registering
service workers, and also installing it on the end user's device home screen.

### Registering a service worker
A service worker is a script that runs in the browser's background. It handles network intercepts from requests and managing caching for offline availability. The create-react-app provided all the tools needed to create a Progressive Web App in React. To configure this to run offline, we need to register the generated service worker file. In the project, open the file named `index.js` and find the code like:
```javascript
// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://cra.link/PWA
serviceWorkerRegistration.unregister() 
```
To opt in using the service worker, change the `serviceWorkerRegistration.unregister()` to `serviceWorkerRegistration.register()`. Workbox has helped us reduce the boilerplate needed every time when working with service workers such as installations,precaching, strategies, requests routing,  and activation. As this will always be generated for you, that resolves the part on how to create a service worker using React.

### Configuring the Web App Manifest
I will use these default icons that is already in the public folder. The favicon.ico, logo192.png, and logo512.png are icons that the user will see on the tab of a mobile or a desktop device.

The `manifest.json` is a JSON file that has metadata to describe how the app will appear to the user.
In our manifest.json file, the code contains icons used as images of different sizes on the home screen.
```JSON
{
  "short_name": "React PWA",
  "name": "A React Todo PWA",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "favicon.ico",
      "sizes": "64x64 32x32 24x24 16x16",
      "type": "image/x-icon"
    },
    {
      "src": "logo192.png",
      "type": "image/png",
      "sizes": "192x192"
    },
    {
      "src": "logo512.png",
      "type": "image/png",
      "sizes": "512x512"
    }
  ],
  "start_url": ".",
  "display": "standalone",
  "theme_color": "#F4BD42",
  "background_color": "#2B2929",
}
```
The functionality of this attributes in the manifest are:

- The attributes `"short_name"` and `"name"` are used within the users' home screens and icon banners respectively.
  
- The `"icons"` is an array containing the set of icons used on home or splash screens.

- The `"start_url"` is the page displayed on startup. In this case the home page.
  
- The `"display"` property will be responsible for the browser view. When standalone, the app hides address bar and runs in a new window like a native app.
  
- `"theme_color"` is the color of the toolbar in the app.

- `"background_color"` is the color of the splash screen.

We will need to link the manifest file to the `index.html` as `<link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />`and add the icon that will point to the apple devices home screen as `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/logo192.png" />` . The index.html markup looks like:
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
    <meta name="description" content="Web site created using create-react-app" />
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/logo192.png" />
    <!--
      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
      user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/
    -->
    <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />
    <!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
    -->
    <title>React Progresive Web App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <!--
      This HTML file is a template.
      If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.

      You can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this file.
      The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag.

      To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
      To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
    -->
  </body>
</html>
```

### Performance of the App
I have used lighthouse to generate an audit report. To test this, we need to generate the build app by runnnin `npm run build` on the terminal. When in developement mode, a static server may be used. Install via npm by running the command `npm install serve`. To start the static server, run the command `serve -s build` and open your browser on `http://localhost:5000`.

> Note that this will not pass the HTTPS audit in the development environment. So if you need hosting, make sure the production web-server supports HTTPS.

Here is the final version of the App:

### Summary
In summary, we learned how to create a Todo app using the React library, with outstanding features such as React Hooks and functional components. We created a Form input and functionality to add todo tasks, mark them as complete and delete the todo tasks. We then explored some introduction to Progressive Web Apps and turned our Todo app into a PWA.
