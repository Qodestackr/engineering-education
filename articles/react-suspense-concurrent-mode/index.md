JavaScript is a single threaded language yet most of the tasks done on the web seems to be blocking. One such task is data fetching. React is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies the data fetching patterns in JavaScript. In this article, we will discuss React suspense and concurrent mode and how they are used to fetch data. A basic understanding of the [JavaScript ES6](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/ECMAScript_2015_support_in_Mozillasyntax) is needed to follow along.


### Objectives
   
1. What is Concurrent mode in React
   
2. Introduction to Suspense component
   
3. How to use Suspense component for data fetching


### The React concurrent mode
React does alot of work under the hood to handle updates to the components and map them to the DOM. Concurrent Mode is a set of changes to the React rendering mechanism so as to essentially let React perform multiple renders concurrently. It can interrupt, delay, or dismiss an ongoing render and defer state updates. This has the benefit of making the application stay responsive while adjusting to user's device capability and network speeds.
You need to change the line `ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootNode)` to:
`ReactDOM.createRoot(rootNode).render(<App />)`

This will enable full Concurrent Mode for your application. To use Concurrent Mode effectively, we will refer to the Suspense that React rolls out together with Concurrent Mode.

### The React Suspense


### Conclusion
Suspense and Concurrent mode is a powerful set of features. It has the benefits to our applications by prioritizing render updates and increasing the userâ€™s performance. It's worth noting that React evolves constantly and this is still an experiemental feature in React. That means that the API may change significantly before it becomes a stable. Once stable, it will be a powerful data fetching pattern on top of other solutions that already work today. I hope you find this article useful.
